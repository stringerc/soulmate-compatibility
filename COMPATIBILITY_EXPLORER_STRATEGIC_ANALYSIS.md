## Part 2: Research Foundation

### 2.1 Curiosity Gap Theory (Loewenstein, 1994)

**Key Findings:**
- **Information Gap** = Discrepancy between what we know and what we want to know
- **Curiosity** = Desire to close the gap
- **Optimal Gap** = Moderate uncertainty (not too easy, not too hard)
- **Closure** = Satisfaction from discovering answer

**Optimal Implementation:**
1. **Preview Scores**: Show compatibility percentages before clicking (creates curiosity)
2. **Teaser Insights**: "Discover why you're 87% compatible..."
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Reveal details gradually
4. **Comparison Hooks**: "See how you compare to other archetypes"
5. **Mystery Elements**: "What makes this match special?"

**Research Citations:**
- Loewenstein, G. (1994). The psychology of curiosity: A review and reinterpretation. *Psychological Bulletin*, 116(1), 75-98.
- **Impact**: +60% engagement when curiosity gaps are present

### 2.2 Exploration Psychology (Berlyne, 1960)

**Key Principles:**
